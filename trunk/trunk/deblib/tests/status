Description: configuration for the exim MTA (v4)
 Provides the configuration for the exim4 daemon packages. The configuration
 framework has been split off the main package to allow sites to replace
 the configuration scheme with their own without having to change the
 actual exim packages.
 .
 Sites with special configuration needs (having a lot of identically
 configured machines for example) can use this to distribute their own
 custom configuration via the packaging system, using the magic
 available with dpkg's conffile handling, without having to do local
 changes on all of these machines.
 .
 Exim (v4) is a fully featured MTA (Mail Transport Agent). It is a drop-in
 replacement for sendmail/mailq/rsmtp and comes with very extensive
 upstream documentation in /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/spec.txt.gz.
 Information about the way Debian has built the binary packages is
 obtainable in /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz, and there
 is a Debian-centered mailing list,
 pkg-exim4-users@lists.alioth.debian.org. Please ask Debian-specific
 questions there, and only write to the upstream exim-users mailing
 list if you are sure that your question is not Debian-specific. You
 can find the subscription web page on
 http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/pkg-exim4-users

Version: 0.5.2-5

Description: The Debian Almquist Shell
 "dash" is a POSIX compliant shell that is much smaller than "bash".
 We take advantage of that by making it the shell on the installation
 root floppy, where space is at a premium.
 .
 It can be usefully installed as /bin/sh (because it executes scripts
 somewhat faster than "bash"), or as the default shell either of root
 or of a second user with a userid of 0 (because it depends on fewer
 libraries, and is therefore less likely to be affected by an upgrade
 problem or a disk failure).  It is also useful for checking that a
 script uses only POSIX syntax.
 .
 "bash" is a better shell for most users, since it has some nice
 features absent from "dash", and is a required part of the system.

  * hashed. An extensible, dynamic hashing scheme.
  * UNIX file oriented. A byte stream file with fixed or variable length
    records.

Description: Secure rlogin/rsh/rcp replacement (OpenSSH)
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It is intended as a replacement for rlogin, rsh and rcp, and can be
 used to provide applications with a secure communication channel.
 .
 This package provides both the ssh client and the sshd server.
 .
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.

 them for transmission by electronic mail services.  `unshar' helps
 unpacking shell archives after reception.  Other related utility
 programs help with other tasks.
 .
 `uuencode' prepares a file for transmission over an electronic
 channel which ignores or otherwise mangles the eight bit (high
 order bit) of bytes.  `uudecode' does the converse transformation.

 .
 o Adduser can create new users and groups and add existing users to
   existing groups.
 o Deluser can remove users and groups and remove users from a given
   group.
 .
 Adding users with adduser is much easier than adding them by hand.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, allow you to set an
 initial password and the GECOS field.
 .
 Deluser can optionally remove and backup the user's home directory
 and mail spool or all files on the system owned by him.
 .
 Optionally a custom script can be executed after each of the commands.
 .
 Adduser is maintained on http://alioth.debian.org/projects/adduser/.
 There is also a development mailing list on
 http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/adduser-devel/.

Description: A fast lexical analyzer generator.
 flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognized lexical
 patterns in text. flex reads the given input files for a description of a
 scanner to generate. The description is in the form of pairs of regular
 expressions and C code, called rules. flex generates as output a C source
 file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine yylex().  This file is compiled
 and linked with the -lfl library to produce an executable. When the
 executable is run, it analyzes its input for occurrences of the regular
 expressions. Whenever it finds one, it executes the corresponding C code.
 .
 The behaviour of Flex has undergone a major change since version
 2.5.4a; Flex scanners are now reenterant, you may have multiple
 scanners in the same program with differing sets of defaults, and
 they play nicer with modern C and C++ compilers. The Flip side is
 that Flex no longer conforms to the POSIX lex behaviour, and the
 scanners require conforming implementations when flex is used in ANSI
 C mode. The package flex-old provides the older behaviour.
 .
 This product includes software developed by the University of California,
 Berkeley and its contributors. The upstream source code can be found at

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the Web
 using http and ftp, the two most widely used Internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as ftp
 sites -- you can use wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the Web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both http and ftp) that support it. Both http and ftp
 retrievals can be time stamped, so wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Version: 2.5.1.ds1-4
Provides: rgrep
Pre-Depends: libc6 (>= 2.3.2.ds1-4)

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

 lanuguage(s) you and your users will want to spell-check.
 .
 It's a good idea to install "wordlist" package(s) for the same
 language(s), because they'll be used by ispell's (L)ookup command.

Description: reports bugs in the Debian distribution
 reportbug is a tool designed to make the reporting of bugs in Debian
 and derived distributions relatively painless.  Its features include:
 .
  * Integration with the mutt, af, and mh/nmh mail readers.
  * Access to outstanding bug reports to make it easier to identify
    whether problems have already been reported.
  * Automatic checking for newer versions of packages.
  * Optional automatic verification of integrity of packages via debsums.
  * Support for following-up on outstanding reports.
  * Optional PGP/GnuPG integration.
 .
 reportbug is designed to be used on systems with an installed mail
 transport agent, like exim or sendmail; however, you can edit the
 configuration file and send reports using any available mail server.
 .
 If your system's users use locales with character sets other than
 UTF-8 and ISO-8859-*, one of either python2.3-cjkcodecs or
 python2.3-iconvcodec is required for proper operation.  For Asian
 locales, the use of python2.3-cjkcodecs is preferred over the more
 limited python2.3-iconvcodec.

 .
 The aim of the library is *not* to replace any available PGP version.
 There will be no real support for key management (sign, revoke, alter
 preferences, ...) and some other parts are only rudimentarily
 available. The main purpose is to handle and understand OpenPGP
 packets and to execute basic operations on them. For example to
 encrypt/decrypt or to sign/verify keys and some packet routines.
 .
 Because of the fact that sensitive data is being handled, the
 library doesn't contain any real cryptographic code. The libgcrypt
 package is used for all crypto routines.

 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

 It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: management of regular background processing
 cron is a background process (`daemon') that runs programs at regular
 intervals (for example, every minute, day, week or month); which
 processes are run and at what times are specified in the `crontab'.
 .
 Users may also install crontabs so that processes are run on
 their behalf, though this feature can be disabled or restricted to
 particular users.
 .
 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator
 (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system
 as well so that you can receive these messages.
 .
 This cron package is configured by default to do various standard
 system maintenance tasks, such as ensuring that logfiles do not
 grow endlessly and overflow the disk.
 .
 The lockfile-progs package is only a "Suggests" because of the poor
 way that dselect handles "Recommends", but I do strongly suggest that
 you install it; it prevents /etc/cron.daily/standard from running multiple
 times if something gets jammed.

Description: Authentication abstraction library
 SASL is the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a method for
 adding authentication support to connection-based protocols. To use
 SASL, a protocol includes a command for identifying and
 authenticating a user to a server and for optionally negotiating
 protection of subsequent protocol interactions. If its use is
 negotiated, a security layer is inserted between the protocol and the
 connection. See RFC 2222 for more information.
 .
 This is the Cyrus SASL API implementation, version 2.
 .
 Any of: ANONYMOUS, CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, GSSAPI (MIT Kerberos 5 or Heimdal
 Kerberos 5), KERBEROS_V4, OTP, PLAIN, or LOGIN can be used. This package
 is unusable without the SASL plugins. Most likely you will need to install

 in a file instead of display it on the screen.
 .
 The resources that `time' can report on fall into the general
 categories of time, memory, I/O, and IPC calls.
 .
 The GNU version can format the output in arbitrary ways by using a
 printf-style format string to include various resource measurements.

Description: MIT Kerberos runtime libraries
 Kerberos is a system for authenticating users and services on a network.
 Kerberos is a trusted third-party service.  That means that there is a
 third party (the kerberos server) that is trusted by all the entities on
 the network (users and services, usually called "principals").

Depends: libc6 (>= 2.2.4-4)
Description: a macro processing language
 GNU `m4' is an implementation of the traditional UNIX macro
 processor.  It is mostly SVR4 compatible, although it has some
 extensions (for example, handling more than 9 positional parameters to
 macros).  `m4' also has builtin functions for including files, running
 shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc.  Autoconf needs GNU `m4' for
 generating `configure' scripts, but not for running them.

Package: strace
Status: install ok installed
Priority: standard
Section: utils
Installed-Size: 200
Maintainer: Roland McGrath <frob@debian.org>
Architecture: i386
Version: 4.5.8-1.2
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.3.2.ds1-4)
Description: A system call tracer
 strace is a system call tracer, i.e. a debugging tool which prints out
 a trace of all the system calls made by a another process/program.
 The program to be traced need not be recompiled for this, so you can
 use it on binaries for which you don't have source.
 .
 System calls and signals are events that happen at the user/kernel
 interface. A close examination of this boundary is very useful for bug
 isolation, sanity checking and attempting to capture race conditions.

Description: 4.4BSD re-implementation of vi
 Vi is the original screen based text editor for Unix systems.
 It is considered the standard text editor, and is available on
 almost all Unix systems.
 .
 Nvi is intended as a "bug-for-bug compatible" clone of the original
 BSD vi editor. As such, it doesn't have a lot of snazzy features as do
 some of the other vi clones such as elvis and vim. However, if all
 you want is vi, this is the one to get.

Description: Pager program similar to more
 Less is a program similar to more(1), but which allows backward
 movement in the file as well as forward movement.  Also, less does not
 have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large input
 files it starts up faster than text editors like vi(1).  Less uses
 termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on a variety of
 terminals.  There is even limited support for hardcopy terminals.
